The entire App is needed to be transferred to version 15 in addition to specific edits and customizations:

    1- Restructure Tender doctype as the one in attached image in the documentation sent.
    2- When creating Comparison from Tender, all common fields should be fetched from the Tender.
    3- Abilitiy of Creating Clearence from Purchase Order.
    4- In this point I'll describe the current behavior and what is the problem in that part in addition to our recommendations for helping in solving it.

    In the Comparison doctype we have a child table "Tender States Template",
        we insert each row, state and corresponding percent to be used later in each clearence item,

        This percents are set to be applied on all items as same as each other,
        The change we want to made is the given percent may be changed from item to another.

        our recommendations to solve:
        1- Adding 4/5 fields for each state in addition to 4/5 fields fot their percents, inside the comparison items.

        2- Solve it by adding new column inside the child table for "Item Code" and linked with "Item" doctype,
        then we can repeat the states with each "Item",
        && in the clearence items, adding a filter on the field "clearance_state" to filter by Clearence Item (Item).

    We are open for any other solutions.
